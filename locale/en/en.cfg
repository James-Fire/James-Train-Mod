[mod-setting-description]
train-tiers=Adds 2 tiers of locomotives with higher weight, power, acceleration, and max speed. Also applies lower max speeds to T1.
train-car-tiers=Adds 2 tiers of wagons with higher max speed and capacity. Also applies lower max speeds and capacity to T1.
weighty-trains=Rolling Stock is heavier baseline, resulting in slower, more powerful-feeling acceleration.
weighty-trains-factor=How much to multiply rolling stock weight by when using the Chonky Trains setting. Default: 5
variable-weighty-trains=Cargo in trains increases weight
powered-rails=Rails that carry power.
battery-power=Batteries for use in Electric Locomotives.
electric-trains=Locomotives that use electricity to move. Can pull power from rails. Also affected by the Locomotive Tier Setting.
electric-train-cars=Wagons that have no base weight, to simulate being powered themselves. Only work with Electric Locomotives. Also affected by the Wagon Tier Setting.
electric-train-upgrade=If this setting is active, each electric train tier is crafted as an upgrade to the normal train instead of as an upgrade to the previous electric train tier. Has no effect if the Tiered Locomotives setting is disabled.
hybrid-trains=Trains that can take conventional fuel and pull power from powered tracks (Not at the same time). Can use Regenerative Braking to recover some energy, but are heavier than electric-exclusive locomotives. Also affected by the Locomotive Tier Setting.
diesel-trains=Locomotives that use fluids with a fuel value. Also affected by the Locomotive Tier Setting.
steam-trains=Locomotives that use steam. Scales with steam temp. Also affected by the Locomotive Tier Setting.
tender-trains=Locomotives can pull fuel from the wagon immediately in front of or behind them.
