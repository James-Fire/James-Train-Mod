[mod-setting-description]
train-tiers=Adds 2 tiers of locomotives with higher weight, power, acceleration, and max speed.
train-car-tiers=Adds 2 tiers of wagons with higher max speed and capacity.
weighty-trains=Rolling Stock is heavier baseline, resulting in slower, more powerful-feeling acceleration.
weighty-trains-factor=How much to multiply rolling stock weight by when using the Chonky Trains setting. Default: 5
variable-weighty-trains=Cargo in trains increases weight
powered-rails=Rails that carry power.
battery-power=Batteries for use in Electric Locomotives.
electric-trains=Locomotives that use electricity to move. Can pull power from rails or batteries. Also affected by the Locomotive Tier Setting.
electric-train-cars=Wagons that have no base weight, to simulate being powered themselves. Only work with Electric Locomotives. Also affected by the Wagon Tier Setting.
electric-train-upgrade=If this setting is active, each electric train tier is crafted as an upgrade to the normal train. If this setting is inactive, only the first electric train is crafted as an upgrade to normal trains, the others are crafted as an upgrade to the previous tier of electric train. Has no effect if the Tiered Locomotives setting is disabled.
diesel-trains=Locomotives that use fluids with a fuel value. Also affected by the Locomotive Tier Setting.
steam-trains=Locomotives that use steam. Scales with steam temp. Also affected by the Locomotive Tier Setting.
tender-trains=Locomotives can pull fuel from the wagon immediately in front of or behind them.
