[mod-setting-description]
train-tiers=Adds 2 tiers of locomotives with higher weight, power, acceleration, and max speed. Also applies lower max speeds to T1.
train-car-tiers=Adds 2 tiers of wagons with higher max speed and capacity. Also applies lower max speeds and capacity to T1.
weighty-trains=Rolling Stock is heavier baseline, resulting in slower, more powerful-feeling acceleration.
weighty-trains-factor=How much to multiply rolling stock weight by when using the Chonky Trains setting. Default: 5
variable-weighty-trains=Cargo in trains increases weight, changing how 
nuclear-trains=Locomotives that use nuclear fuel cells. Nuclear trains are heavy, but powerful.
powered-rails=Rails that carry power.
powered-rails-adjacent=Powered Rails extend their power area beyond the rails, allowing them to power machines directly adjacent to the rails. This setting does nothing if Fluidic Power is active.
powered-rails-diff=What indicator (or lack of) is used to differentiate powered rails that are placed in the world.\nAllowed options are non-exclusive (You can insert any number, or none) and are:\ncopper-wire: Each rail segment will have visible wires to adjacent rail segments.
battery-power=Batteries for use in Electric Locomotives.
electric-trains=Locomotives that use electricity to move. Can pull power from rails. Also affected by the Locomotive Tier Setting.
electric-train-cars=Wagons that have no base weight, to simulate being powered themselves. Only work with Electric Locomotives. Also affected by the Wagon Tier Setting.
electric-train-upgrade=If this setting is active, each electric train tier is crafted as an upgrade to the normal train instead of as an upgrade to the previous electric train tier. Has no effect if the Tiered Locomotives setting is disabled.
hybrid-trains=Generates hybrid trains based on the other train types generated. They can take the normal fuel for their train type and pull power from powered tracks (Not at the same time). Can use Regenerative Braking to recover some energy, but are heavier than either fuel-exclusive or electric-exclusive locomotives. Also affected by the Locomotive Tier Setting.
train-update-count=Powered Rails has to manually update electric train power supplies. Lower numbers will mean better performance, but having more than 5x this many electric trains running at any one time will cause them to occasionally lose power.
diesel-trains=Locomotives that use fluids with a fuel value. Also affected by the Locomotive Tier Setting.
steam-trains=Locomotives that use steam. Scales with steam temp. Also affected by the Locomotive Tier Setting.
tender-trains=Locomotives can pull fuel from the wagon immediately in front of or behind them.
